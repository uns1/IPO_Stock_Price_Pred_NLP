## Twitter Sentiment Analysis for IPO Stocks

The goal is to predict the direction of a stock's price, using sentiment data on tweets. We exclusively look at recent IPO stocks only, as IPO stocks might have 'less' (in relative terms) information about the company in the public domain and hence, sentiment might play a bigger role in stock movements.

Contains: 
- iPython notebook to do sentiment analysis (using Naive Bayes, Vader etc.) and joining the data with our other datasets.
- The rest of the code can be found in Ingrid Wijaya's repository. https://github.com/IngridWijaya3/Predicting-IPO-Return-using-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
